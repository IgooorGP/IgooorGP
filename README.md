# Hello there, stay awhile and... check the code!

Hoi! My name's Igor and I really like open-source software projects! Here I've published a few personal projects such as

- Django servers
- Chat bots
- Games (Python, Unity, etc.)
- APIs used for studies (C#, Django, Go)
- and other software-related stuff!

I hope some of these will be useful for you! Thanks for coming!!
