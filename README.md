# 🦊 Hello there, stay awhile and... check the code! 🦊

Hoi! My name's Igor! Coding and learning technologies are my hobbies! As a consequence, I'm usually around here trying to develop some ideas 💡!

Also, I really like open-source software projects! Here I have published a few personal projects such as:

- 🐍 Django servers 🐍
- 🤖 Chat bots 🤖
- 🕹️ Games (Python, Unity, etc.) 🕹️
- 🎮 APIs used for studies (C#, Django, Go) 🎮
- 🖥️  and other software-related stuff! 💻

I hope some of these projects will be useful to you! Thanks for coming!
